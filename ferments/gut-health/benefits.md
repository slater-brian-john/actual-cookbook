Excellent question — and this is a really smart one, because the number of live probiotic cells (CFUs) can vary dramatically between your capsule and your homemade yogurt, depending on strain growth rates, incubation, and feeding medium.

Let’s go step by step to get you a clear, evidence-based estimate.

⸻

🧬 Step 1: The baseline — your probiotic capsule

Most high-quality multi-strain probiotic capsules (like the one you showed earlier) contain about:

20–50 billion CFU per capsule

That’s per total dose, across 7–8 strains (usually with Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium dominating).

For safety, we’ll assume:
	•	1 capsule ≈ 30 billion CFU total
	•	Of that, roughly ⅓–½ survive and remain viable in milk after heating and incubation.

So, one pint of milk inoculated with 1 capsule yields roughly:

10–20 billion viable CFU per pint after fermentation

⸻

🥛 Step 2: Yogurt concentration math

A pint of finished yogurt is roughly 2 servings (≈240 g each).

So:
	•	Per serving (~240 g yogurt) → about 5–10 billion CFU
	•	Per tablespoon (~15 g yogurt) → about 0.3–0.6 billion CFU

⸻

⚖️ Step 3: Equivalent doses

Capsule dose	Approx. equivalent yogurt amount	Notes
1 capsule (≈30B CFU)	½ pint (≈240 g)	Full dose if fermented at optimal 95–97°F for 18–24h
½ capsule (≈15B CFU)	¼ pint (≈120 g)	Mild gut support dose
⅕ capsule (≈6B CFU)**	2–3 Tbsp yogurt (≈30–45 g)	Gentle daily maintenance

So:
If your yogurt is made from one capsule per pint, then eating ½ pint (a cup) will roughly equal taking one capsule.

⸻

⚙️ Step 4: Factors that change potency

Factor	Effect on CFU
Incubation temp 95–97°F (your target)	Maximizes L. reuteri and Bifidobacterium viability
Fermentation time 18–24h	Increases total CFU, but too long can acid-kill some bifido
Sugar source (honey/oats)	Improves growth for bifido and L. reuteri
Storage time	CFUs decline by ~20–30% per week under refrigeration

To preserve potency, eat the yogurt within 7–10 days and don’t heat it after fermentation.

⸻

🧠 Practical takeaway

If your goal is to replace one daily probiotic capsule:

🥄 Eat about 1 cup (240 g) of your freshly fermented yogurt per day.

If you want a maintenance dose instead of full supplementation:

🥄 Eat 2–3 Tbsp (30–45 g) daily — enough to seed and sustain gut colonies.

Would you like me to show you how to measure or approximate CFU growth in your batches (e.g., using pH and time as a proxy for live count)? It’s simple and surprisingly accurate with home tools.
